# TSMB2: Fractal Images

Fractal Images is a Black MIDI originally composed by blacker TSMB2. In 2018,
I made an arrangement of this piece for solo piano.

* [Watch the original video of my arrangement here](https://youtu.be/uWPOpbC8npE).

Note that the sheet music lists the arranger as "Miguel Guthridge". My new name
is Maddy Guthridge. Please use my new name to refer to me.

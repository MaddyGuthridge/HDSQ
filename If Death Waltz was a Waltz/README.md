# If Death Waltz was a Waltz

I made an arrangement of the classic Black MIDI "UN Owen Was Her", aka
"Death Waltz", but changed the time signature to 3/4, as a celebration of April
Fool's Day 2017. The arrangement gets progressively worse over the course of
the piece, culminating in what I consider to be the worst chord that has ever
been endured by human ears at the end.

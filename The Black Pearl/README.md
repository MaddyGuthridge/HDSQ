# The Black Pearl

This is my arrangement of the classic piece from the soundtrack of Pirates of
the Caribbean.

This arrangement was originally called "The (very) Black Pearl" in reference to
its very high note count, but I have since changed its name due to it sounding
a little questionable to me.

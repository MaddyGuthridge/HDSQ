# 花音: The Sound of a Flower

This is an original composition, written for solo piano.

* [Watch the original video here](https://youtu.be/C4YaffMF1IA).

Note that the MuseScore file has been updated to reflect the way that I play
it, as opposed to the way it is shown in the original video. It still has some
formatting issues (due to the MuseScore 3 to 4 update), but if I get time, I
will update it with fixes.

The MIDI file is the original version, which is presented in the video.

# Despacito

I made this arrangement of Despacito back in 2017 when the song wasn't cringe
yet. My mum then prevented me from publishing it for months, and it was cringe
by the time I published it. This was so sad, Alexa play Despacito.

Ok, now that I've gotten the shitposting out of my system, I'm unironically
proud of my arrangement of this -- it slaps pretty hard, especially in the
second verse.

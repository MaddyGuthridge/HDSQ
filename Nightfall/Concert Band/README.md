# Nightfall - Concert Band

This is my concert band arrangement of Nightfall. I composed this as my major
work for HSC Music 1 in my final year of high school, receiving full marks.

Note that the sheet music lists the composer as "Miguel Guthridge". This is me,
but my old name. Please refer to me as Maddy Guthridge.

If I find them, I will also upload the MuseScore project files for this work.

HDSQ, short for hemidemisemiquaver (a 64th note), is a music project I started
in 2016, where I created [Black MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_MIDI),
a micro-genre of music utilising MIDI files that contain tens of thousands, or
even millions of notes.

I'm incredibly proud of the music I created, and so I am using this repository
as a way to archive and share my work with the world.
